     * We are running PostgreSQL test containers inside a bridged (user-derfined)
     * network.  Testcontainers expects to be able to connect to the _host_ and
     * map ports on the host.  However we are running _inside_ a docker container.
     * So now the mapping to _localhost:randomport_ -> spawned postgres:5432 is
     * available from _outside_, but not form the docker container actually
     * spawning the others.
     *
     * We also can't refer to them by name, because docker somehow fails to
     * resolve names sometimes once a container has joined a network but didn't
     * get a name assigned when joining :shurg:.
     *
     * We can however refer to containers by their containerId, or more
     * precisely by their _short_ (first 12 char) Id.
     *
     * So we overwrite the jdbcUrl, and change the way it's constructed in test
     * containers.
     *
     * This is a mess :(
